<p>Grounding Activities</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Option A: Field trip to where there used to be a lot of pinon trees, Hyatt Gazebo (need permission), Jemez Dam (need permission), Bosque Beach at Willow Trail.  The purpose of this field trip is to ground students in recognizing what is important to them as individuals, family members, and community members in an open setting away from school where they can make connections to places where climate change is visible.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Bring food to create a sense of community. This would be a great place to collaborate with teachers in other classes.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Have an informal talk about what the students care about most deeply and why.  Ideally, include someone from the school or community who is known for being able to engage with students on multiple levels (i.e. Lorilei, someone from Student Success, etc.).  This is not necessary though.</p>

<li>
<p>Prompts</p>
<ol class="">
<li><p>What are you looking forward to most this season, this school year, in the next 5 years?  Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Share your favorite memory of something that made you happy.  Why did this make you happy?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Or use another preferred method of giving students space to share their values and goals</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>From what the students currently know, have them share: How has the river changed over time?   What is the importance of the river to our cities, communities, families?  What is causing these changes?</p></li>

<p>Family Interviews</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Students will ask a family member or community member the following questions.  Encourage them to reframe the questions in their own words.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>What were your favorite places to visit or spend time at throughout your childhood?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have any specific memories?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you still able to visit those places?  How often?</p></li>
<li><p>What changes have you seen in those places?</p></li>
<li><p>Have those changes affected you?  If so, how?</p></li>

<li><p>Have students draw their core values, family, and future goals on large sheets of paper.  They could also print out pictures that they took that are of their family or representations of their core values, family, or future goals.  (Note: Students can use a <a class="external" href="https://jamboard.google.com/d/1mqousBQDMIPcUuV2iMbm0lsQ2UggPechLwBUt13EI7E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Jamboard</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-32-hidden.html" title="Footnote 32"><sup> 32 </sup></a> to share out as well).</p></li>

<p>Activities</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Option A: Math connection: Students will use maps and graphs to analyze environmental justice and understand how pollution disproportionately affect people who are poor and members of racial and ethnic minorities. This lesson can be accessed <a class="external" href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/classroom-resources/lessons/analyzing-environmental-justice" target="_blank">here</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-33-hidden.html" title="Footnote 33"><sup> 33 </sup></a>. How would mathematics describe the ways that their environment has changed over time? Do these data and graphs exist?</p>
<ol class="lower-roman"><li><p>Another math exploration can be doing using this <a class="external" href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/61bb8eeb8336cc6954bb31b6" target="_blank">Desmos activity</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-34-hidden.html" title="Footnote 34"><sup> 34 </sup></a></p></li></ol>
</li>
<li><p>Option B: Option B: Drive down 550 to the entrance of Chaco Canyon to observe the presence and impact of the oil industry.</p></li>
<li><p>Option C: PhotoVoice style potential placeholder</p></li>
<li><p>Option D: Rio Grande Field Trip.  From river access points near Cochiti Pueblo, San Felipe, Santa Ana, Bernalillo, Sandia, and Isleta Pueblos, create learning opportunities that recognize the changes of the river over time to how that impacts the communities.  What have the communities had to do to manage water resources?</p></li>

<li>
<p>Planning next steps</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What can I do in my education and career path to address climate change?</p></li>
<li><p>What can I do for my community, family, and self to address climate change?</p></li>
<li><p>How can these concerns be explored mathematically? What questions do I have that can be described using rates of change, statistics, and measurements? What quantitative trends am I curious about?</p></li>
<li><p>Have students write thank you notes for the family/community members who helped them engage with this unit.  For [extra] credit, students can explain what they learned, how this person helped bring deeper understanding to what they learned, and how this will benefit their community and/or family and individual goals.</p></li>
