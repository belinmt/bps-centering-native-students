<p>Indigenous communities in New Mexico have been impacted by contamination of radioactive materials from uranium mining activities and nuclear research at the Los Alamos National Laboratories. These impacts continue to affect multiple generations of Indigenous families. Pueblo and Navajo communities and nations affected by these activities are awareness and assessment of these impacts with hopes of reducing and preventing additional impacts of contamination from radioactive materials. This context will allow Indigenous students and students with ties to other impacted communities in New Mexico to connect the relevance of lessons related to these Chemistry standards to issues affecting their families and communities.</p>
