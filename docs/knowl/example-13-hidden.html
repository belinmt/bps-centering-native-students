<p>Suggested classroom activities: Describe to students how “Corn provides tall stalks for the beans to climb so that they are not out-competed by sprawling squash vines. Beans provide nitrogen to fertilize the soil while also stabilizing the tall corn during heavy winds. Beans are nitrogen-fixers meaning they host rhizobia on their roots that can take nitrogen, a much needed plant nutrient, from the air and convert it into forms that can be absorbed by plant roots. The large leaves of squash plants shade the ground which helps retain soil moisture and prevent weeds.” (From Native Seeds webpage)</p>
<p>Questions: How does growing tall like corn help you as you get older? What parts of your body help you to stand and walk and keep you stable like beans do in helping to keep roots stable? What parts of your body is used to protect you from the sun or other objects like leaves of squash plants?</p></article></body>
