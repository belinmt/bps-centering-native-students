<p><em class="emphasis">In-class exercise:</em> Materials needed: scale or balance, jars with lids, thermometer, marker, soil collected from different natural local locations.</p>
<p>Fill a jar halfway full with water and close tightly with a lid. Stick a thermometer in the water and weigh the jar. Record the weight and the temperature. Then, stick the jar outside to be warmed by the sun. After several minutes, record the temperature and weight.</p>
<p>Next, use the jar and water to conduct soil texture activity (<a class="external" href="https://www.soils4kids.org/files/s4k/soil-texture-experiment.pdf" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://www.soils4kids.org/files/s4k/soil-texture-experiment.pdf</code></a>). Tell students where soils were collected from so they can figure out the soil texture in those locations.</p>
<p>Refer to the “Background Agricultural Connections” portion of this website (<a class="external" href="https://agclassroom.org/matrix/lesson/print/365/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://agclassroom.org/matrix/lesson/print/365/</code></a>) to talk to students about the importance of knowing soil texture for farming. Next, mix two different types of soil samples and redo the soil texture analysis.</p></article></body>
