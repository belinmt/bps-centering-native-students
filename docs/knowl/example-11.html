<p>Description: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects in darkness can be seen only when illuminated.</p>
<p>Conduct Lesson Two, “Science through Story: The Sun, Moon, and Stars”. Take home exercise: Ask students to go home and observe the stars and to find the constellations from the “Culminating Activity” of “Pueblo Creation Story: Our Awe Inspiring Cosmos”. Ask students to ask their family or community members if there are names in their Native language(s) to the different constellations. Questions: What time was it easiest for you to see the constellations? How “bright” was the moon? Why do you think the moon “brighter” at night? If the moon was bright, did you see more stars closer or further away from the moon? Why do you think it is easier to see stars at night?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="SCI-3.html#example-11" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
