<p>Pueblo and other Indigenous worldviews include deeper connections and relationships with animals, plants, and other forms of life. Animals are viewed as non-human relatives and are consistently present in stories, songs, and other traditions. The listed biology standards can be presented to students where understanding the functions and concepts surrounding plant life, animal life, and ecosystems are important to understanding our relationships to plants and animals and how we can protect our non-human relatives and ecosystems. Additionally, students can learn about efforts led by Indigenous communities to recognize rights of nature.</p>
