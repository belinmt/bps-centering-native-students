<p>Description: Make observations to provide evidence that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electric currents.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">In-class or take home exercise:</em>In this exercise, have students tap different objects like tables, shelves, desks with their hands like a drum.  Ask students to change the speed at which they “drum” and to make observations about how objects on a table, desk, chair, that they respond to their drumming.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Questions:</em>How does the speed of hitting a drum with a drumstick relate to the sound created by the drum? What happens to the sound when you hit the drum faster? What happens to other objects on the table/desk/shelf when you drum? Do objects move more when you drum faster or slower?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="SCI-3.html#example-50" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
