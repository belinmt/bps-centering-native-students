<p>The physics lessons learned in this group of standards serves as a basis for geophysics, the study of the physics of Earth and its environment in space. Geophysics is also the branch of science that studies volcanoes and volcanic activity. New Mexico is a land rich with volcanic history and activity. Pueblos and other Indigenous peoples in New Mexico have unique connections and stories related to volcanic features and places in New Mexico. Connections between volcanic activity and places and Indigenous peoples is also observed throughout the world. This context uses these connections between NM and Indigenous peoples with volcanic areas to make these physics and geophysics lessons relevant to students.</p>
