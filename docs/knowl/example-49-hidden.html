<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Description: Use evidence to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">In-class or take home exercise:</em>In this exercise, have students tap different objects like tables, shelves, desks with their hands like a drum.  Ask students to change the speed at which they “drum” and to make observations about how objects on a table, desk, chair, that they respond to their drumming.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Questions:</em>How does the speed of hitting a drum with a drumstick relate to the sound created by the drum? What happens to the sound when you hit the drum faster? What happens to other objects on the table/desk/shelf when you drum? Do objects move more when you drum faster or slower?</p></article></body>
