    <title>Understanding Climate Change, Global Warming, and the Impact on Our Communities in New Mexico</title>
    <assemblage><title>Content Area: Science, Math, Native American and Indigenous Studies</title>
      <p>Grade levels: 11-12 </p>
      <p>Rationale: Climate change endangers all beings of the earth.  Education on climate change is not only vital to the survival of future generations but also to the ways of life that have been passed on to us by our ancestors.  In the last few decades the impact of climate change has become more clearly visible to our societies.  In the last few years, we have witnessed the devastation of melting glaciers, rising sea levels, abnormal tornadoes, overwhelming heat waves, extensive drought, extreme wildfires, and intense winter storms.  This has led to rapid animal extinctions, reduced sustainable farmlands, destruction of infrastructure, and the politicalization of science.  Essentially, this has caused and will continue to cause another wave of colonial destruction to our ways of life globally, continentally, and locally.  This is a central issue across all subject areas as it impacts our history, our politics, our wellness, our communication, our planning, our economic systems, our traditions, our ecosystems, and the sustainability of who we are.  This unit can be embedded into math, science, or Native American Studies classes.  Ideally, this can/would be a collaborative unit across courses (including English, Social Studies, Arts, Electives, Languages, etc.).  This is a model unit that can and should be adapted to fit the dynamics of the teachers and students.</p>

             <li><p>Grounding Activities</p>
                 <p><ol>
                     <li><p>Option A: Field trip to where there used to be a lot of pinon trees, Hyatt Gazebo (need permission), Jemez Dam (need permission), Bosque Beach at Willow Trail.  The purpose of this field trip is to ground students in recognizing what is important to them as individuals, family members, and community members in an open setting away from school where they can make connections to places where climate change is visible.  </p>
                         <p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><p>Bring food to create a sense of community. This would be a great place to collaborate with teachers in other classes. </p></li>
                                 <li><p>Have an informal talk about what the students care about most deeply and why.  Ideally, include someone from the school or community who is known for being able to engage with students on multiple levels (i.e. Lorilei, someone from Student Success, etc.).  This is not necessary though.</p>

                     <li><p>Option A: Math connection: Students will use maps and graphs to analyze environmental justice and understand how pollution disproportionately affect people who are poor and members of racial and ethnic minorities. This lesson can be accessed <url href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/classroom-resources/lessons/analyzing-environmental-justice">here</url>. How would mathematics describe the ways that their environment has changed over time? Do these data and graphs exist?</p>

                     <li><p>Option D: Rio Grande Field Trip.  From river access points near Cochiti Pueblo, San Felipe, Santa Ana, Bernalillo, Sandia, and Isleta Pueblos, create learning opportunities that recognize the changes of the river over time to how that impacts the communities.  What have the communities had to do to manage water resources? </p></li>

                     <li><p>What can I do for my community, family, and self to address climate change? </p></li>
                     <li><p>How can these concerns be explored mathematically? What questions do I have that can be described using rates of change, statistics, and measurements? What quantitative trends am I curious about? </p></li>
                     <li><p>Have students write thank you notes for the family/community members who helped them engage with this unit.  For [extra] credit, students can explain what they learned, how this person helped bring deeper understanding to what they learned, and how this will benefit their community and/or family and individual goals.  </p></li>
