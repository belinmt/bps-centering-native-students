  <title>Culturally Responsive Science Framework </title>  
    <introduction>
        The purpose of this framework is to provide additional detail for developing a culturally responsive science curriculum. This supplementary framework should be used in addition to the “Culturally Responsive Curriculum Framework: Indigenous Communities and Pueblo Nations Served by Bernalillo Public Schools”. This section will include: 
        <ul>
            <li>Core Values in Practice</li>
            <li>Examples inside and outside Bernalillo Public Schools</li>
            <li>Prevalent Symbols and Impacts of Colonization </li>
            <li> Centering Students </li>
            <li>Desired Outcome</li>
        </ul>

        <title>Centering Students</title>
        <ul>
            <li>Teach science concepts in place-based contexts</li>
            <li>Support students in learning terminology in their Native languages and relating to traditional stories</li>
            <li>Teach students about STEM-related issues that impact Indigenous peoples like climate change, energy development, genetics research (re: claims to Indigeneity), endangered species</li>
            <li>Teach students history of science and that there are multiple ways of knowing but Western Science has dominated education</li> 
            <li>Expand the definition of “science” in classrooms to show how daily activities of students are ways that students practice science
</li>
            <li>Use examples of how Indigenous knowledge and TEK have affirmed or added to larger body of science knowledge</li>
            <li>Point to science that has been done by Indigenous scientists</li>
            <li>Hands on lessons</li>
            <li>Collaborate with local tribal environmental and natural resources departments</li>       
         </ul>

        <title>Desired Outcomes</title>
        <ul>
            <li> Students will understand science lessons and concepts as not being abstract but a part of their communities and everyday lives</li>
            <li>Students will understand how science can be used to address issues facing their families and communities</li>
            <li>Students will understand the lack of inclusion of Indigenous knowledge/voices in dominant STEM practice and education is a result of the Western science framework and colonial practices</li>
            <li>Students will better understand how to see themselves as scientists and their potential to succeed in science</li>
