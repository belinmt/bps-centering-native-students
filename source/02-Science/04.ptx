            <title>Context 1: Non-human relatives and the rights of nature</title>
            <p>Pueblo and other Indigenous worldviews include deeper connections and relationships with animals, plants, and other forms of life. Animals are viewed as non-human relatives and are consistently present in stories, songs, and other traditions. The listed biology standards can be presented to students where understanding the functions and concepts surrounding plant life, animal life, and ecosystems are important to understanding our relationships to plants and animals and how we can protect our non-human relatives and ecosystems. Additionally, students can learn about efforts led by Indigenous communities to recognize rights of nature. </p>

            <title>Context 1: Uranium contamination and impacts of Los Alamos National Laboratories </title>
            <p>Indigenous communities in New Mexico have been impacted by contamination of radioactive materials from uranium mining activities and nuclear research at the Los Alamos National Laboratories. These impacts continue to affect multiple generations of Indigenous families. Pueblo and Navajo communities and nations affected by these activities are awareness and assessment of these impacts with hopes of reducing and preventing additional impacts of contamination from radioactive materials. This context will allow Indigenous students and students with ties to other impacted communities in New Mexico to connect the relevance of lessons related to these Chemistry standards to issues affecting their families and communities. </p>

            <title>Context 1: NM’s Volcanic history and Indigenous connections to volcanic places</title>
            <p>The physics lessons learned in this group of standards serves as a basis for geophysics, the study of the physics of Earth and its environment in space. Geophysics is also the branch of science that studies volcanoes and volcanic activity. New Mexico is a land rich with volcanic history and activity. Pueblos and other Indigenous peoples in New Mexico have unique connections and stories related to volcanic features and places in New Mexico. Connections between volcanic activity and places and Indigenous peoples is also observed throughout the world. This context uses these connections between NM and Indigenous peoples with volcanic areas to make these physics and geophysics lessons relevant to students. </p>
